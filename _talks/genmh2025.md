My work at the AZA Lab was selected as a virtual oral presentation at the Generation Mental Health 2025 Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. This work focuses on how group music therapy (GMT) can reduce stress and anxiety, increase social connection, and enhance synchrony in the nervous system among people living in high-trauma environments like prisons/carceral environments and recovery centers.

Individuals in carceral and recovery facilities often experience intense and repeated trauma, along with chronic stress. These experiences can dysregulate the autonomic nervous system and contribute to poor mental health outcomes. However, most therapeutic approaches in these environments don’t address the biological impact of trauma or leverage social connection as a healing mechanism.
