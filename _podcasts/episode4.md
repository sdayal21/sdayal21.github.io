Why do some individuals continue to experience debilitating neurologic symptoms long after their initial COVID-19 infections? How might our own immune systems be the culprit? In this episode of the YJBM podcast, we learn more about the post-acute infection syndrome known as “long COVID” and the challenges associated with trying to understand its underlying mechanisms. Join co-hosts Shivani and Roxanna as they interview Dr. Lindsay McAlpine and Dr. Keyla Sá, researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine, about their work investigating the pathophysiology of long COVID-associated neurologic symptoms.
