How can we leverage the legal system and the medical system to best support the communities these systems should be serving? 

In this episode, our hosts Shivani and Shankeri interview the dearly admired Dr. Suzi Ruhl, a lawyer and epidemiologist who shares her expertise on equitably building individual and community resiliency by tackling highest priority conditions created by health, economic and environmental challenges. In this lively and enlightening conversation, Dr. Ruhl expresses the link between environmental justice and public health, the disproportionate impact of environmental, economic and health burdens faced by minority, low-income and tribal communities, and the legal, medical, and environmental dimensions to providing equitable healthcare.
