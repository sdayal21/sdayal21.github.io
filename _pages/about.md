## <span style="color:#2F5496;">Hello and Welcome!</span>

I’m a US-based Singaporean **public health professional** focused on **social and behavioral sciences** and psychiatric research. 

At **Yale’s** [AZA Lab](https://www.azalab.org/), I study how **music-based therapies** reduce stress, support emotional regulation, and enhance social and nervous system synchrony in conditions like dementia and Parkinson’s. I’ve presented this work at the [Generation Mental Health Conference](/talks/genmh2025) and the [Society for Neuroscience Conference](/talks/sfn2025).

I hold an MPH from **Yale School of Public Health** (Social and Behavioural Sciences) and a **B.A. in Psychology from Yale-NUS College**, where I also explored behavioral effects of hormonal contraceptives and presented at the [Human Behaviour and Evolution Society Conference](/talks/hbes2024) and the [International Association for Conflict Management](/talks/iacm2024).

I graduated with **Honours** from the 5-year [concurrent degree program](https://ysph.yale.edu/school-of-public-health/graduate-programs/mph-joint-degree/5-year-ba-bs-mph/), supported by the **H. L. Kwee Scholarship** and a full merit-based undergraduate scholarship.

Beyond research, I’m a trained **Indian Classical vocalist**, songwriter, and aspiring music producer. I enjoy **Argentine Tango, Digital & Physical Art, and Music**, and love museums, musical theatre, and dancing.
