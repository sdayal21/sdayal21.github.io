I heard people describe this artwork as many things, it reminded some of a woman bent over in pain, some noticed the woman holding onto a caring hand and found that particularly meaningful, some likened the colours and shape of her back to a beating heart or a heart on an operating table. I appreciated and really valued hearing all interpretations. This art was created to depict the pain and isolation of women facing reproductive health issues in a system that often diminishes their pain, minimises their needs, and leaves their medical concerns unaddressed due to sexist research and medical practices embedded in the structure of the healthcare system.

"The greatest damage done by neglect, trauma or emotional loss is not the immediate pain they inflict but the long-term distortions they induce in the way a developing child will continue to interpret the world and her situation in it." - Gabor Maté, Author of 'In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction'

"We are less when we don't include everyone." – Stuart Milk, American LGBTQ Human Rights Activist

This work was created in honor of the researchers, social workers, and medical practitioners navigating historical medical moulds to create room for diverse and more inclusive systems of research & treatment. They pave the way for novel treatment methods, wield out-of-the-box thinking, and collaboratively tackle systemic oppression. Much like a puzzle, it is impossible to predict the exact methods of this endeavour before beginning. Medicine and public health are indebted to the individuals pioneering movements towards health justice.
