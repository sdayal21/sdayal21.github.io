What does it mean to love and care for someone who has a different way of experiencing the world? How can we understand the way emotions may be expressed to us differently than they were before in a relationship?

In this episode, our host Shivani has a conversation with researcher, professor, and artist Dr. Joan Monin. Dr. Monin shares her interest and work in the boundaries of how close relationships work, how we provide comfort to one another, and how understanding our relationships help us in older-adult caregiving in the context of dementia onset and recovery.
