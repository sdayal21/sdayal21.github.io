"We are less when we don't include everyone." – Stuart Milk, American LGBTQ Human Rights Activist

This work was created in honor of the researchers, social workers, and medical practitioners navigating historical medical moulds to create room for diverse and more inclusive systems of research & treatment. They pave the way for novel treatment methods, wield out-of-the-box thinking, and collaboratively tackle systemic oppression. Much like a puzzle, it is impossible to predict the exact methods of this endeavour before beginning. Medicine and public health are indebted to the individuals pioneering movements towards health justice.
