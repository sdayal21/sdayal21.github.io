This was a production of the Broadway Musical AIDA, telling the story of star-crossed lovers in a time of war between Egypt and Nubia. I played the female lead 'Aida', a strong-willed and intelligent Nubian princess torn between following her heart and staying true to her loyalty to her people and nation. Check out videos from the final performances of this show!
