"The greatest damage done by neglect, trauma or emotional loss is not the immediate pain they inflict but the long-term distortions they induce in the way a developing child will continue to interpret the world and her situation in it." - Gabor Maté, Author of 'In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction'
