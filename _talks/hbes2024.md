My thesis project was selected as a poster presentation for the HBES Conference in Aarhus, Denmark. This work focused on investigating the impact of Hormonal Contraceptive (HC) methods on Non-Mate-Seeking, and documented our findings across three different domains: Risk-Taking, Competitive Decision-Making and Negotiations. 

Previous research indicates that these behaviours could be linked to hormonal fluctuations, but most research that investigates the impact of hormonal contraceptives focuses on reproductive and social impacts within 'mating-domains', while financial decision-making, workplace-relevant behaviours, and non-mating interpersonal behaviours remain relatively underexplored. This project aims to fill that gap, and lies at the intersection of my interest in women's health and social behaviour.
