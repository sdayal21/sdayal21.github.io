I heard people describe this artwork as many things, it reminded some of a woman bent over in pain, some noticed the woman holding onto a caring hand and found that particularly meaningful, some likened the colours and shape of her back to a beating heart or a heart on an operating table. I appreciated and really valued hearing all interpretations. This art was created to depict the pain and isolation of women facing reproductive health issues in a system that often diminishes their pain, minimises their needs, and leaves their medical concerns unaddressed due to sexist research and medical practices embedded in the structure of the healthcare system.
