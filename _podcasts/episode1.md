In this episode of the YJBM podcast, Shivani interviews Dr. Kai Chen, an environmental epidemiologist, researcher, and Professor at the Yale School of Public Health. In this interview, Dr. Chen discusses his work, the links between heat exposure and cardiovascular health, air quality and students’ academic scores, and wildfire smoke and mental health outcomes.
